## 🎯 Why TaskWise?

People with ADHD often struggle with task prioritization and executive dysfunction. TaskWise aims to combat common time-management obstacles by reimagining productivity through a neurodivergent-friendly lens. It's not about forcing yourself into a system; it's about building a system that flexes with you. 

TaskWise helps users: 
- Plan based on energy and focus rather than arbitrary time blocks
- Break through task paralysis with gentle, dopamine-aware nudges
- Learns from real-time behavioral data to optimize scheduling
